/--
The `@[struct]` attribute instructs the compiler to use the struct backend for the
tagged inductive type, generating direct C struct representations instead of the
default boxed object representation.

This is useful for data structures where:
- All constructors have the same layout (single constructor types work best)
- Performance is critical and boxing overhead should be avoided
- The type will be used frequently in tight loops or memory-sensitive contexts

Example usage:
```lean
@[struct]
structure Point where
  x : Float
  y : Float
```

This generates a C struct instead of a heap-allocated object, improving performance
and memory locality.
